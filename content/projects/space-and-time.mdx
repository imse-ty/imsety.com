summary: >
  I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Ravie.co](https://ravie.co/) on two
  videos for Space and Time, a decentralized data warehouse focusing on
  blockchain and AI.


  Here's a breakdown of how I helped


  * Led the creative direction of a social media hype video for Space and Time's
  new AI bot, Houston. A tool that enables developers to write code by simply
  asking a question. With the help of [Will Taylor (aka
  wlroo)](https://wlroo.design/), who is known for his signature knack for UI
  animations, and [Sam Essanoussi](https://www.instagram.com/sam.essanoussi/).

  * Crafted a beautiful 3D galaxy scene as the final "wow moment" for a Space
  and Time brand film.

## Meet Houston

The main challenge was to decide which aspects of the product to showcase while keeping the presentation stylish.

    { image: "/projects/space-and-time/ai/styleframe-3.jpg" }
  ]}
/>

Initially, I aimed for a high-end appearance, but after exploration, I found out that the client preferred a more literal and minimalistic approach, where we would take existing designs of the app and enhance them with motion.

    { image: "/projects/space-and-time/ai/styleframe-8_02.jpg" }
  ]}
/>

My knowledge in development proved to be helpful for this project. Once I finalized the visual style, I took care of the technical aspects and deconstructed the UX designs provided by the Space and Time team.

Meanwhile, Will was responsible for UI animation and developed a motion language using the visual style I had developed, which served as the foundation for the project, effectively turning our workflow into an assembly line.

## Brand film

<ProjectVimeo url="https://vimeo.com/822311251?share=copy" />

My role in this project was to create the best galaxy sequence ever, which included additional scenes such as the animation of a blockchain graph in 3D and the merging of two dwarf stars.

<ProjectGrid
  images={[
    {
      image:
        "/projects/space-and-time/brand-film/2022-09-15_scene-12-13_imsety_frame-13-test_v0.14.png"
    },

        "/projects/space-and-time/brand-film/2022-09-13_planets-and-galaxy_imsety_0.20.png"
    }
  ]}
/>

The galaxy underwent several changes before reaching its current iteration that we are familiar with.
