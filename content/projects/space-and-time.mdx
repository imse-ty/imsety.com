summary: >
  For Space and Time, a cool player in the blockchain world, I led a video
  project alongside Will Taylor (wlroo) and the talented folks at Ravie.co. We
  had two big tasks: whip up a slick brand film that shows off what Space and
  Time is all about, and create an eye-catching video for their new AI tool,
  Houston. Houston's a game-changerâ€”it lets people use SQL without needing to
  code. They wanted a vibe like Microsoft, mixing sleek with techy. We got our
  creative gears spinning and delivered videos that really put Space and Time's
  innovative spirit in the spotlight.
