summary: >
  For Space and Time, a cool player in the blockchain world, I led a video
  project alongside Will Taylor (wlroo) and the talented folks at Ravie.co.


  We had two big tasks: whip up a slick brand film that shows off what Space and
  Time is all about, and create an eye-catching video for their new AI tool,
  Houston. A tool that enables developers to write code by simply asking a
  question.
