summary: >
  Leading the initial creative direction for [Ravie.co](https://ravie.co/), I
  worked on Splice's social campaign, a top name in royalty-free music samples.
  Our focus was their new 'Create a Stack' feature, in collaboration with
  [STORM+SHELTER](https://stormandshelter.com/) and [Ronorco
  Audio](https://ronrocoaudio.com/).


  Splice asked us to create ads for their new AI-powered tool that generates
  "Stacks" of complementary samples tailored to specific genres for music
  artists.

      We were given early access to the "Create a Stack" feature on Splice. We
      had a great time making our own music tracks, and used our experience with
      the product as a guide to conceptualize the video.

## Process

The main challenge was finding the right balance between creating an abstract video with magical visuals while also keeping it informative.

<ProjectGrid

    { image: "/projects/splice/process/3D Stack 1.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/3D Stack 3.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Splice_R&D 4.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Splice_R&D 6.png" }
  ]}
/>

I had to design with both vertical and horizontal formats in mind, as it was intended for use on Instagram and YouTube viewing. Everything was made in square 4K format to easily be cropped to any aspect ratio required.

We went far and wide, exploring many iterations and drafts to find the proper stride alongside [Varvara Vorobyeva](https://www.instagram.com/barbara.frames/), [Will Taylor](https://www.instagram.com/visualsbywlroo/), and [Sam Essanoussi](https://www.instagram.com/sam.essanoussi/).

I created a concept for a band of instruments representing the sables during R\&D and explored creative ideas around it.

<ProjectGrid

    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Instrument Exploration R&D_2.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Instrument Exploration R&D_3.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Instrument Exploration R&D_1.png" }
  ]}
/>

Initially, the project was going well, but as time passed, we realized it needed significant changes. We felt the video lacked a coherent story and needed improvement. So, we regrouped, focused on refining its message, and improved its overall quality.

    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Frame 2.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Frame 05 copy.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Frame 15.png" },
    { image: "/projects/splice/process/Artboard 2 copy 3.png" }
  ]}
/>

### 15-second cutdowns

Splice needed various versions of their video, in both vertical and horizontal orientations, along with shorter versions showcasing specific parts for different target audiences.

Toward the end of the project, I repurposed existing assets created by the team and me to create 15-second versions of the video.

Sebastián Anús and Juan Regidor from Ronroco Audio knocked it out of the park with the sound design for these videos and elevated them to a whole new level.
