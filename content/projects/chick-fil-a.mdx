summary: >
  At Chick-fil-A's annual company event NEXT 2023 and the subsequent smaller
  event, Spark 2023, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Brand Apart and
  Ravie.co.


  Chick-fil-A, famous for its chicken sandwiches, organizes these events to
  unite their community and ignite new ideas. NEXT is their annual corporate
  gathering, while Spark offers a space for more focused, imaginative sessions.


  My contribution spanned various creative domains, from developing eight
  speaker walkups to crafting a range of additional essential assets.

      Diving into this project meant crafting speaker walkups for an impressive
      lineup â€“ think auto and fashion industry leaders, a Pixar genius, a Navy
      SEAL, top authors, and the brains from tech giants like Apple.
