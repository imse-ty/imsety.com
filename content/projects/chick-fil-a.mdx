summary: >
  At Chick-fil-A's annual meeting, NEXT 2023, and its subsequent bi-annual
  event, Spark 2023, I had the opportunity to work on a series of animated
  speaker walk-up videos for [Ravie.co](https://ravie.co/) in association with
  [Brand Apart.](https://brand-apart.com/)


  Chick-fil-A, famous for its (delicious!) chicken sandwiches, organizes these
  events to unite their community and ignite new ideas.


  My contribution spanned various creative domains, from helping develop
  eight-speaker walkups to crafting a range of additional 3D assets that were
  used throughout the work.

## NEXT 2023

This project was the first big live event I worked on for Ravie. Therefore, there were new processes and challenges to face, like designing and animating in a widescreen format.

### Process

When the group brainstormed motion concepts for each speaker walkup, I helped by thinking up creative ways to tell a story.

Blending a lightbulb into Pixar's Luxo Jr. lamp, I symbolized an ex-Pixar speaker's influence on big companies by playfully turning it into the central zero in a Fortune 500 logo.

Alongside helping with conception, design, and animation, I focused on adding 3D elements while maintaining Chick-fil-A's soft gradient style for the event.

To maintain the project's 2D visual look, many initial designs were drawn by hand in Adobe Illustrator and then recreated inside Cinema 4D, effectively creating a "Fake-2D" workflow.

This process elevated the walkup scenes, solving the problem of having the "wow moments" without a drastic style shift.

## Spark 2023

For Spark, we began with using playful shapes and blocks as the visual language for the event, but later in the project, Chick-fil-A pivoted with a new visual system resembling their familiar red-and-white look.

### Process

My role was primarily animating, figuring out fast and efficient ways to bring these designs to life. I also had a hand in designing some scenes and concepts.

I worked alongside the project's design and conception squad, led by [Varvara Vorobyeva](https://www.instagram.com/barbara.frames/), [Noah Damon Wilde](https://www.instagram.com/noahdamonwilde/), and [Austin Bauwens](https://www.instagram.com/austinbauwens/), who created simple and fun designs that set the tone for the entire project.
