summary: >
  At Chick-fil-A's annual company event NEXT 2023 and the subsequent smaller
  event, Spark 2023, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Brand Apart and
  Ravie.co. Chick-fil-A, renowned for its fast-food chain specializing in
  chicken sandwiches, hosts these events to bring together its community and
  spark innovative ideas. NEXT serves as a grand corporate meet-up, while Spark
  focuses on more intimate, creative collaborations. My contribution spanned
  various creative domains, from developing eight speaker walkups to crafting a
  range of additional essential assets.
