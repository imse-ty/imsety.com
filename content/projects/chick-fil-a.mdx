summary: >
  At Chick-fil-A's annual company event NEXT 2023 and the subsequent smaller
  event, Spark 2023, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Brand Apart and
  Ravie.co.


  Chick-fil-A, famous for its chicken sandwiches, organizes these events to
  unite their community and ignite new ideas. NEXT is their annual corporate
  gathering, while Spark offers a space for more focused, imaginative sessions.


  My contribution spanned various creative domains, from developing eight
  speaker walkups to crafting a range of additional essential assets.

## NEXT 2023

This project was the first big live event I worked on for Ravie. Therefore, they were new process and challenges to face, like designing and animating in a widescreen format.

Alongside helping with concepting, design, and animation, I focused on adding 3D elements while maintaining Chick-fil-A's sleek gradient style for the event.

For each speaker walkup, the group brainstormed concepts for the motion. Most notably, I helped concept the "Storyteller" walkup for Chick-fil-A.

## Spark 2023

For Spark, we begun with using shapes and blocks to build things out, but later in the project Chick-fil-A had a new visual system resembling more of that familiar red and white look. My role was primarily animation.![](/projects/chick-fil-a/spark-2023/spark-2023-Frame8.png)![](/projects/chick-fil-a/spark-2023/spark-2023-Frame4.png)![](/projects/chick-fil-a/spark-2023/spark-2023-Frame11.png)
