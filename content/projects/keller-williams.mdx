summary: >
  In my recent projects with Keller Williams, I had the opportunity to dive into
  some really exciting motion design work for two of their big events: Mega
  Agent Camp 2022 and Family Reunion 2023.


  For Mega Agent Camp, I teamed up with Ravie to transform some basic 2D and
  2.5D designs into a cool 3D collage, which was a fun challenge. For Family
  Reunion, we focused on a story-driven opener, where I contributed to the
  concept, storyboard, and animation.
