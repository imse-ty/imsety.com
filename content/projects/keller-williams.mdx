summary: >
  In my recent projects with Keller Williams, I had the opportunity to help
  create pre-opening videos for two big events: Mega Agent Camp 2022 and Family
  Reunion 2023.


  For Mega Agent Camp, I teamed up with [Ravie.co](https://ravie.co/) to
  transform some basic 2D and 2.5D city skyline into a sleek 3D compositioin.


  For Family Reunion, we focused on a story-driven opener, where I contributed
  to the concept, storyboard, and animating the beginning sequence of the
  opener.

## Mega Agent Camp 2023

My task was simple: take an existing scene with collage-style 2D buildings, and add a 3D twist to it.

## Family Reunion 2023

For this event, the video's opening sequence iterated through many takes of the scene.

I had the chance to design my version of the arrow sequence (later animated by [Will Taylor](https://wlroo.design/)). Below are some initial drafts along with additional frames, including the end card.
