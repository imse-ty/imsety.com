summary: >
  At Beeple Studios' Art Charleston event, I showcased "The Breakdown," a piece
  combining turntablism, jazz, and hip-hop with fast-paced animations. Created
  entirely by me — visuals, music, and sound — this project was a thrilling
  blend of my love for dynamic movements and diverse music.
