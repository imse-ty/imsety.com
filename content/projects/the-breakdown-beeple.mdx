summary: >
  At Beeple Studios with Gibbes Museum of Art, I showcased "The Breakdown," a
  piece combining turntablism, jazz, and hip-hop with fast-paced animations.
  **All visuals, music, and sound were created entirely by me!**


  This project was the perfect combination of my love for creating abstract
  stories and producing catchy beats to create music visuals and interactive
  experiences.

      I created a unique beat by blending a soulful oldie with some retro
      hip-hop beats. Sampling the classic Beyond The Sea by Ray Conniff and the
      Alphabet Aerobics by Blackalicious.

## Process

After I posted my story about how the motion design industry inspired me, Beeple reached out to me and invited to submit my artwork to the Art Charleston and Beeple Studios event.

### Creating the beat and realizing the vision

What if you saw two turntables, like a DJ set, and one half of the screen was taken over by a color-coded sample? As the two vinyl records combine, you would see a bunch of fun shapes interacting with each other on beat.

In 2021, I produced a beat in which I combined a cover of “Beyond the Sea” by Ray Conniff and "Alphabet Aerobics" by Blackalicious and created a DJ-like remix. Years later, I decided to repurpose this track for this project.

### Storyboard and styleframes

I imagined and sketched a storyboard, then developed styleframes in Cinema 4D and After Effects, shaping the narrative's skeleton.

## Final showcase

Over seven days, I animated the piece, investing 60 hours in its creation. The result was beyond satisfying.
