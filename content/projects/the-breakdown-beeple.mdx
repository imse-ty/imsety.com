summary: >
  At Beeple Studios' Art Charleston event, I showcased "The Breakdown," a piece
  combining turntablism, jazz, and hip-hop with fast-paced animations. Created
  entirely by me — visuals, music, and sound — this project was a thrilling
  blend of my love for dynamic movements and diverse music.

## Process

After posting my story of how I got inspired by the motion design industry, Beeple reached out to me, inviting me to submit my artwork to the Gibbes Museum Of Art & Beeple Studios event.

### Creating the beat and realizing the vision

What if you see two turntables, like a DJ-set, and one-half of the screen gets taken over by the sample indicated by a color? The two vinyl records combine and you see a bunch of fun shapes interacting with each other on beat.

In 2021, I produced a beat where I combined a cover of “Beyond the Sea” by Ray Conniff and Alphabet Aerobics by Blackalicious and created a DJ-like remix out of it. I decided to repurpose this beat years later for this idea.

### Storyboard and styleframes

I imagined and sketched a storyboard, then developed styleframes in Cinema 4D and After Effects, shaping the skeleton of the narrative.

## Final showcase

Over seven days, I animated the piece, investing 60 hours in its creation. The result was beyond satisfying.
