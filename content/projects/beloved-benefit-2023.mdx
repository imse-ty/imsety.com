summary: >
  For the Beloved Benefit, an inspiring Atlanta-based charity event, I
  collaborated with Brand Apart and Ravie to craft a captivating graphics
  package and pre-opener. My role included reconstructing the event space in
  Unreal Engine, ensuring a seamless integration of visuals into the actual
  environment. This project delivered a striking pre-opener and a comprehensive
  set of event graphics, contributing significantly to the event's visual
  storytelling and community spirit.
