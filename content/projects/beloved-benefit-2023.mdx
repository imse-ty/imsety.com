summary: >
  The Beloved Benefit is an event hosted by Atlanta-based community organization
  The Same House. I helped craft a captivating pre-opener and a comprehensive
  set of event graphics for [Ravie.co](https://ravie.co/), in collaboration with
  [Brand Apart](https://brand-apart.com/).


  Making it happen:


  * I reconstructed the event space in Unreal Engine, turning tiny screen drafts
  into full-scale visualizations and giving the team a sneak peek weeks before
  showtime.

  * Involved in shaping the concept, design, and animation of "wow moments" of
  the pre-opener and primary look of the show.

  * Managed the not-so-easy workflow of displaying content in a massive 27k sq.
  ft. venue with millions of pixels.

  * Led the charge in crafting on-demand screen flourishes to jazz up live
  performances.

## Process

Drawing inspiration from fiber optic cables and sparkles, the Ravie team and I came together to R\&D how these lines could be used in the space. My early ideas focused on a "holodeck" concept simulating Atlanta landmarks with stars and lines, including a recreation of Piedmont Park.

Each member of the time designed their visual take on the event. We took the best parts from each and combined them to come up with the final visual language.

### Pre-opener

Working on the pre-opener led me to create the opener's intro and "wow moment" sections for particular parts of the stage.

The challenge was figuring out a gorgeous presentation for the venue's inverted U-shaped space with screens on the ceilings and walls. This led us to create two distinct yet harmonized pre-openers with crossover moments across the stage.

### Unreal Engine

I reconstructed the entire stage in Unreal Engine as a virtual space, using assets provided by the venue production and templates provided kindly by [Joe Wiggleston](https://vimeo.com/joewiggleston) and [Will Fortanbary](https://fort-studios.com/) from Brand Apart.

The biggest challenge was finding a way to preview work for this ample space on tiny computer monitors and making the high-resolution files play reliably inside Unreal Engine. Alongside [Austin Bauwens](https://www.instagram.com/austinbauwens), I figured out methods and workflows that the entire team could work with.

### Additional deliverables

Among various sub-deliverables, like ambient visuals for John Legend, metallic text, final donation number reveals, and stage transitions, I led the creation of on-command stage flourishes.

### Beneficiary walkups

Developed alongside [Sam Essanoussi](https://www.instagram.com/sam.essanoussi) and Will Taylor, early on, we explored having a special walkup video for each beneficiary of the event like [Urban League](https://ulgatl.org/) and [RICE](https://russellcenter.org/).

### Broadcast logo

I created a unique logo bumper for Brand Apart's broadcast edition of Beloved Benefit; everyone from the team had a chance to put their take on the logo. This was my take out of the bunch, which was selected for the official broadcast. Sound design courtesy of [Ronroco Audio](https://ronrocoaudio.com/).
