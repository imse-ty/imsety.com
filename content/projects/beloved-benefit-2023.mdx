summary: >
  For the Beloved Benefit, an Atlanta-based charity event, I collaborated with
  Ravie and Brand Apart to craft a captivating pre-opener and a comprehensive
  set of event graphics.


  Making it happen:


  * I reconstructed the event space in Unreal Engine, turning tiny screen drafts
  into full-scale visualizations and giving the team a sneak peek weeks before
  showtime.

  * Involved in shaping the concept, design, and animation of the pre-opener and
  primary look of the show.

  * Managed the not-so-easy workflow of displaying content in a massive 27k sq.
  ft. venue with millions of pixels.

  * Led the charge in crafting on-demand screen flourishes to jazz up live
  performances.

## Process

Drawing inspiration from fiber optic cables and sparkles, the Ravie team and I came together to R\&D how these lines could be used in the space. My early ideas focused on a "The Matrix" concept representing Atlanta landmarks with stars and lines, including a recreation of Piedmont Park.

### Pre-opener

Working on the pre-opener led me to create the opener's intro and "wow moment" sections for particular parts of the stage.

The challenge was figuring out a gorgeous presentation for the venue's inverted U-shaped space with screens on the ceilings and walls. This led us to create two distinct yet harmonized pre-openers with crossover moments across the stage.

### Unreal Engine

I reconstructed the entire stage in Unreal Engine as a virtual space, using assets provided by the venue production and templates provided kindly by Joe Wiggleston and Will Fortanbary from Brand Apart.

### Additional deliverables

Among various sub-deliverables, like ambient visuals for John Legend, final donation number reveals, and stage transitions, I led the creation of on-command stage flourishes.

### Beneficiary walkups

Early on, we explored having a special walkup video for each beneficiary, Urban League and RICE, developed alongside Sam Essanoussi and Will Taylor.

### Broadcast logo

I created a unique logo bumper for Brand Apart's broadcast edition of Beloved Benefit; everyone from Ravie had a chance to put their take on the logo. This was my own take out of the bunch, which later got used in the official broadcast! Sound design courtesy of Ronroco Audio.
