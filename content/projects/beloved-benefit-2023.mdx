summary: >
  For the Beloved Benefit, an Atlanta-based charity event, I collaborated with
  Ravie and Brand Apart to craft a captivating pre-opener and a comprehensive
  set of event graphics.


  Making it happen:


  * Reconstructed the event space in Unreal Engine, turning tiny screen drafts
  into full-scale visualizations, giving the team a sneak peek weeks before
  showtime.

  * Invovled in shaping the concept, design, and animation of the pre-opener and
  primary look of the show.

  * Managed the not-so-easy workflow of displaying content in a massive 27k sq.
  ft. venue with millions of pixels.

  * Led the charge in crafting additontal deliverables such as cool, on-demand
  screen flourishes to jazz up live performances.

      The event lit up with Chris Tucker's humor and John Legend's melodies. I
      had the chance to craft the visuals for these engaging performances.
