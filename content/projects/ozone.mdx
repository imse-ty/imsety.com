summary: >
  I had the exciting opportunity to collaborate with Ravie.co on a project for
  Ozone, an startup offering AI-powered video editing services. Ozone automates
  the way videos are edited, adding captions and effects automatically, akin to
  Frame.io but enhanced with AI.


  The task was not only to create a captivating 30-second brand film promo but
  also to develop a foundational brand identity for Ozone. Our creative
  direction and output set the tone for Ozone's brand image, serving as a
  template for their future marketing and branding initiatives.
