summary: >
  I had the exciting opportunity to collaborate with Ravie.co on a project for
  Ozone, an innovative startup offering AI-powered video editing services. Ozone
  is revolutionizing the way videos are edited, adding captions and effects
  automatically, akin to Frame.io but enhanced with AI.


  The task was not only to create a captivating 30-second brand film promo but
  also to develop a foundational brand identity for Ozone. Our creative
  direction and output set the tone for Ozone's brand image, serving as a
  template for their future marketing and branding initiatives. This project was
  a blend of creativity and cutting-edge technology, showcasing the
  transformative power of AI in video editing and content creation.
