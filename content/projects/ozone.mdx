summary: >
  Ozone is a startup that automates video editing using AI by automatically
  adding cuts, captions, and effects. I had the chance to work on rigging and
  animating the "Super Cut" sequence of this 30-second product video for
  [Ravie.co](https://ravie.co/) alongside additional scenes.


  With creative direction led by [Varvara
  Vorobyeva](https://www.instagram.com/barbara.frames/) and [Noah Damon Wilde,
  ](https://www.instagram.com/noahdamonwilde/)the visual style of the final
  video set the tone for Ozone's brand image and was a template for their alpha
  launch marketing and branding.

## Process

We initially created the video with quick and energetic animations emphasizing motion. However, we felt that it did not communicate the message the client wanted. As a result, we settled on a "Super Cut" scene that walked the audience through the app's experience.

I had the pleasure of animating this scene and creating the base animation for other parts of the video, including the "Color Corrects" sequence and "Resize Content Magicly."
