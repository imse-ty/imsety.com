summary: >
  I had the exciting opportunity to work on "Rock The Campus," a collaboration
  involving 2 Chainz, Rock The Bells, Ford, and Alabama State University.


  The project, initiated by [Maya Table](https://www.mayatable.com/) from [Sam
  Frank Productions](https://www.samfrankproductions.com/) and [Cisco
  Newman](https://www.cisconewman.com/) from [The Funnel
  Creative](https://www.thefunnelcreative.com/), was a three-part video series
  combining music, narrative, and vibrant college culture.


  My role involved animating graphics and bringing Kae McGowan's collage-style
  designs to life.
