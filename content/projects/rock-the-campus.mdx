summary: >
  I had the exciting opportunity to work on the "Rock The Campus" project, a
  collaboration involving 2 Chainz, Rock The Bells, Ford, and Alabama State
  University. The project, initiated by Maya Table from Sam Frank Productions
  and Cisco Newman from The Funnel Creative, was a three-part video series
  combining music, narrative, and vibrant college culture.


  My role involved animating graphics, bringing to life the creative designs of
  Kae McGowan. The series was structured to provide a satisfying story arc for
  each episode, with the finale being a dynamic concert moment.
